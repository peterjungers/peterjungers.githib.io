				<h2>The Liberty Bell</h2>

				<p>Our time spent in Sea Isle City must have been about a week. After that we headed toward Philadephia to visit my dad's youngest brother and his wife (I kept calling them "Uncle" and "Aunt"). They lived outside the city proper, on the New Jersey side. On one of our days there, my family took a day trip to downtown Philadelphia to see some of the historic sites. Once again, I don't remember much: a hazy recollection of looking at the liberty bell (was it behind glass?); touring the courtroom where the United States' independence was declared (or is that a memory from a movie in 5th grade social studies class?).</p>

				<h2>The Statue of Liberty</h2>

				<p>Within a few days, we headed northeast through New Jersey, stopping at an old house on a country road. The family in the house were friends of ours from the Midwest. The father in the family was now a pastor in a church nearby—perhaps the church was on the same property as the house. I don't recall if we stopped only for lunch, or stayed the night, but I seem to remember the next day, as I stood beneath the statue and looked across the bay at the New York City skyline, that our family was not traveling alone on its visit there. One thing that I certainly haven't forgotten was that, unbeknownst to us beforehand, the statue was closed that day. We hung around Liberty Island for an hour or so before heading back west. I always found it a bit peculiar that we never ventured into the city itself that day. For the longest time I believed I had never actually been in the state of New York: when looking at a map, Liberty Island is within the border of New Jersey, which runs through the Upper New York Bay. I found it interesting, and a bit of trivia, that the Statue of Liberty is actually in the state of New Jersey. It wasn't until later in life that I learned that the island is in fact an exclave of the borough of Manhattan: I've been to New York after all.</p>

				<p>At some point soon after these trips to historic sites, after our visit to the beach, we embarked on the long journey home. I don't believe we drove straight through again on our way back to Colorado. I'm pretty sure we stopped and spent some nights in Illinois to be with the friends that had remained there after we had moved away years before.</p>
